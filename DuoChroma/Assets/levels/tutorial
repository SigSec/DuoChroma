It should contain the layout of the map.
The split takes place halfway through the level, therefore levels should have an even height.

Tiles:
	a = Air, a space the user can walk through.
	d = Door, opens when you have a key.
	e = Empty, a dark block.
	g = Gem, refills the health of the side the player is on.
	k = Key, increases keycount, needed to open doors.
	m = Multigem, the object that ends the level
	t = Tile, a block the user can stand on.
